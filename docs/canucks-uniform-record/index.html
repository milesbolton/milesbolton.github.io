            <p>By <a href="https://github.com/milesbolton">Miles Bolton</a></p>
        </div>
       <p>In January, <i>Daily Hive Vancouver</i> reported that the Canucks win more when they wear their alternate uniforms — their vintage 
            black, yellow and red "skate" set.</p>
        <p>This was technically true. At the time, the Canucks were 9-1-0 in their skate uniform and 8-3-2 in their regular home set. By the end 
            of the regular season, the Canucks averaged more goals per game and had a higher winning percentage in games they wore their alternate 
            uniforms.</p>
        <p>The Canucks had a winning percentage of 0.71 in games they wore their skate uniforms. This was 10 points higher than games they wore their 
            home uniforms — a 0.60 winning percentage. On the road, their winning percentage was 0.56, and they wore their white road uniforms for all 41 
            away games.</p>
        <p>What <i>Daily Hive</i> failed to account for in this article was which games the team picked to wear their throwbacks. This season, they 
            were generally worn against weaker opponents, allowing the Canucks to score more goals. The home uniforms, conversely, were often worn for 
            games against better teams.</p>

            <div class="flourish-embed flourish-cards" data-src="visualisation/18968018"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><br>

        <p>The Canucks wore the skate uniforms for 17 games in 2023-24, scoring an average of 3.65 goals per game in these contests. When they wore the 
            home uniforms, they scored slightly less, averaging 3.42 goals per game. On the road, they averaged 3.29 goals per game — less than they did 
            during home games.</p>
        <p>Vancouver has given up fewer goals, on average, in games they wear the home uniforms. In these games, the Canucks average 2.33 goals against. 
            In games they wear the skate uniform, they average 2.53 goals against. On the road, they give up an average of 3.02.</p>
        <p>It's easy to refute these numbers, given the smaller sample size of skate jersey games. But the Canucks' alternate jersey schedule, which leans 
            heavily toward opponents in the lower echelon of the NHL standings, and abnormally high-scoring games, is also to blame.</p>

            <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/18960998"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><br>

        <p>The average rank of the Canucks' opponent during skate jersey games was 22 out of 32. The skate uniform was worn against many bottom-tier teams like 
            the Anaheim Ducks, Chicago Blackhawks, Columbus Blue Jackets and twice against the San Jose Sharks, who finished last in the NHL this season.</p>
        <p>At the time of each game, only one team the Canucks faced in their skate uniform was ranked in the league's top 10 — the Dallas Stars, who beat the 
            Canucks 3–1 on March 28.</p>
        <p>The home uniform was worn against several top-rate opponents, including eight games against top 10 teams.</p>
