      <h1>MLB stadiums are getting smaller. Here's what's happening to all the seats.</h1>
      <p class="subhead">The average MLB stadium in 2024 is over 10,000 seats smaller than the average
        stadium in 1994. The numbers behind this trend explain the new era of stadium construction.

      <p>By <a href="https://jonathansoma.com">Miles Bolton</a></p>
    </div>
    <p>When Rogers Centre — originally known as Skydome — opened in 1989, it was a trendy, state-of-the-art multipurpose 
      stadium that answered the calls from Toronto sports fans asking for a domed stadium to house the Blue Jays and the 
      CFL's Toronto Argonauts. Its round concrete skeleton, connected by dimly-lit ramps, was built with the same 
      infrastructure as many stadiums housing baseball and football across North America.</p>
    <p>The lower level stands, divided in half, stood on tracks, meeting in one corner to fit behind a baseball diamond. 
      When the Argonauts played, they rotated so that they ran parallel to each other, allowing a rectangular football field
      to run down the middle. The upper deck was built in a round shape, forming to the outer shape of the building and providing
      a view of both sports that didn't make sense for either — though not terrible.</p>
    <p>Multi-purpose stadiums defined sporting venues from the 1960s to the 1990s. They made sense economically: one stadium,
      could be home to multiple teams, regardless of the shape of the field. These stadiums were large, most fully enclosed with
      seats, giving owners room to sell more tickets.</p>
    <p>Multi-purpose stadiums were popular from the 1960s to the 1990s. They made sense economically: one stadium,
      could be home to multiple teams, regardless of the shape of the field. These venues were large, most fully enclosed with
      seats, giving owners room to sell more tickets.</p>
    <p>In the early 1990s, MLB teams building new stadiums began shifting back to traditional ballparks, which featured stands
      build around a baseball field and open outfields. This shift lowered capacity, as football stadiums generally have more seats. 
      In the following decade, more multi-purpose facilities closed, giving way for ballparks and further decreasing seating 
      capacity across MLB.</p>
    <p>The average capacity of an MLB stadium in 1994 was nearly 52,000. That number has decreased incrementally over the 
      past 30 years. In 2024, the average capacity has dropped to under 42,000 — a decrease of around 20 percent.</p>

      src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

    <p>Of the stadiums that have had their seating capacity slashed during this time, the Blue Jays have removed the most amount
      of seats in an effort to transform Rogers Centre into a baseball-specific venue — Tropicana Field, the home of the Tampa Bay Rays, 
      officially has the largest capacity decrease, but this is due to the Rays closing their upper deck and covering seats with tarps, 
      artificially reducing capacity.</p>
    <p>After offseason renovations between the 2022 and 2024 seasons, Rogers Centre's capacity has dropped from over 50,000 to just over
      39,000 — adapting to a new generation of fans and stadium trends. The following images show how the building has changed, and how
       other venues across baseball have made similar changes.</p>

          <p>This is what Rogers Centre looked like until the end of the 2022 season. Some of the lower bowl seats, still in 
            their multi-purpose configuration, do not face the action.</p>
          <p>The Blue Jays have had trouble selling upper bowl tickets. The upper deck outfield seats, as shown in the photo,
            were sparsely populated during most games.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="step" id="step2">
        <p>This was Rogers Centre in 2023, after the first major offseason renovation to repurpose 
          seating. Most of the old outfield seats were converted into bars and standing room areas allowing 
          fans to congregate and watch games in a more casual setting.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step" id="step3">
        <p>A similar renovation is taking place at Progressive Field in Cleveland, home of the Guardians. This is what it looked
          like before 2015. It has upper deck seating in right field, like Rogers Centre used to.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step" id="step4">
        <p>This is Progressive Field after the 2015 renovations. Notice how the upper deck seating on the right side has been
          converted into boxes.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step" id="step5">
        <p>Other teams have made similar renovations to their stadiums. Coors Field in Denver, shown here, converted most of its 
          upper deck outfield seating into bars. These renovations have contributed to the smaller venue trend taking baseball by storm.</p>
