      <h1>MLB stadiums are getting smaller. Here's what's happening to all the seats.</h1>
      <p class="subhead">The average MLB stadium in 2024 is over 10,000 seats smaller than the average
        stadium in 1994. The numbers behind this trend explain the new era of stadium construction.
      </p>

    <div class="byline">
      <p>By <a href="https://github.com/milesbolton">Miles Bolton</a></p>
    </div>
    <p>When Rogers Centre — originally known as Skydome — opened in 1989, it was a trendy, state-of-the-art multipurpose
      stadium that answered the calls from Toronto sports fans asking for a domed stadium. Its round concrete skeleton, 
      connected by dimly-lit ramps, was built with the same infrastructure as many stadiums housing baseball and football 
      across North America.</p>
    <p>The lower level stands were divided in half and stood on tracks, meeting in one corner to fit behind a baseball diamond 
      when the Blue Jays played. When the CFL's Toronto Argonauts played, the stands rotated so that they ran parallel to each other, 
      allowing a rectangular football field to run down the middle. The upper deck's round shape was moulded to the outer shape of 
      the building, providing a view of both sports that didn't make sense for either — though not terrible.</p>
    <p>Multi-purpose stadiums like Rogers Centre were popular from the 1960s to the 1990s. They made sense economically: one stadium, 
      home to multiple teams regardless of the shape of their playing surface. These venues were large, most fully
      enclosed with seats, giving owners room to sell more tickets.</p>
    <p>In the early 1990s, MLB teams building new stadiums began shifting back to traditional ballparks, which featured
      stands build around a baseball field and open outfields. This shift lowered capacity, as football stadiums generally 
      have more seats. In the following decade, more multi-purpose facilities closed, giving way for ballparks and further 
      decreasing seating capacity across MLB.</p>

    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-pictogram" data-src="visualisation/18786100">
      <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
    </div><br>

    <p>The average capacity of an MLB stadium in 1994 was nearly 52,000. That number has decreased incrementally over
      the past 30 years. In 2024, the average capacity has dropped to under 42,000 — a decrease of around 20 percent.</p>
    <p>Of the stadiums that have had their seating capacity slashed during this time, the Blue Jays have removed the
      most amount of seats in an effort to transform Rogers Centre into a baseball-specific venue — Tropicana Field, 
      the home of the Tampa Bay Rays, officially has the largest capacity decrease, but this is due to the Rays closing 
      their upper deck and covering seats with tarps,
      artificially reducing capacity.</p>
    <p>After offseason renovations between the 2022 and 2024 seasons, Rogers Centre's capacity has dropped from over
      50,000 to just over
      39,000 — as the team adapts to a new generation of fans and stadium trends. The following images show how the building has
      changed, and
      how other venues across baseball have made similar modifications.</p>

          <p>Until the end of the 2022 season, Rogers Centre maintained its original seating layout. Some of the lower bowl seats,
            still in
            their multi-purpose configuration, did not face the action.</p>
          <p>The Blue Jays have had trouble selling upper bowl tickets to many games. The upper deck outfield seats, as shown in the
            photo,
            were often sparsely populated.</p>

          <p>In 2023, the first major offseason renovation was completed as the team removed around 8,000 seats in the outfield. 
            Most of these seats were converted into bars and standing room areas, allowing fans to congregate and watch games 
            in a more casual setting.</p>
          <p>The lower bowl was rebuilt the following offseason to improve sightlines and create a new club seating area behind 
            home plate. This further decreased the stadium's seating capacity as around 2,000 more seats were removed.</p>

        <p>A similar renovation is taking place at Progressive Field in Cleveland, home of the Guardians. Before 2015, it too had upper

          <p>After the 2015 renovations, Progressive Field's right field upper deck seats were converted into 
            terraces, allowing groups of fans to watch games together as if they were standing at a bar. This renovation caused 
            around 6,000 seats to be removed.</p>
          <p>The Guardians will be making more renovations to Progressive Field over the next few years.</p>

    <p>Across MLB, teams have either replaced their large, aging stadiums with smaller, contemporary ones, or renovated their 
      home venues to remove seats, replacing them with social areas and clubs. The Texas Rangers, Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins 
      have the three newest stadiums in MLB. All three replacements are smaller than their predecessors.</p>
    <p>This trend is reflected by many teams across baseball.</p>

    <p>The driving factors behind the smaller venues are intimacy, premium seating and fan experience.</p>
    <p>In 2020, <i>Sports Travel Magazine</i> <a 
      href="https://www.sportstravelmagazine.com/sports-venue-design-capacity-seating-venues-shrinking-rangers-baseball/#:~:text=Driving%20experiences%20for%20fans%20with,capacity%20within%20the%20existing%20footprint.">reported</a> 
      that teams were struggling to fill larger venues consistently. The MLB regular season has 81 home games, of which only a few 
      are big enough draws to sell out, like Opening Day, or New York's subway series between the Mets and the Yankees.</p>
    <p>“The sizes start to shrink because they’re trying to right-size the market,” Christopher Lamberth, the head of sports 
      architecture at tvsdesign, told STM in 2020. “You get that increased intimacy.”</p>

    </figure>

    <p>Keeping fans engaged during games is also a priority for teams. The current generation of fans wants more in-game entertainment 
      and spaces that go beyond watching the game.</p>
    <p>Baseball has a more social atmosphere than other sports. It's common for fans to chase after baseballs in the stands and sample 
      food items unique to each stadium. By replacing banks of seating with open bars and interactive spaces, teams can cater to the 
      next generation of fans while eliminating unused seats.</p>
    <p>New ballparks also emphasize premium hospitality areas like suites and club seating. Tickets for these sections 
      are more expensive, so while the number of seats decreases, teams can set higher ticket prices.</p>
    <p>“That’s kind of the crux of where we are with design right now,” Byron Chambers, the senior principal at Populous and design 
      director of the firm’s Dallas office told STM in the same article. “The idea 25 years ago where you may have 50,000 seats and the 
      way the revenue models work with revenue sharing and the competition for the entertainment dollar — it’s not about getting a bunch 
      of people to the game, it’s about having a custom tailored experience while they’re there.”</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Walk around almost any MLB stadium in use this season, and you'll find a venue built for the modern fan. Want to sit and watch the game? 
      There are still thousands of seats for that. Grab a drink and chat with a friend at the bar? Head to the outfield. And hey, why not grab 
      a <a href='https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/39816781/mlb-2024-new-ballpark-food'>hot dog ... wrapped in a quaesadilla ... and topped 
      with french fries and cracker jack?</a></p>
    <p>Yes, you can really find it all at a baseball game in 2024. Just don't forget that there's still a game on.</p>
