                <figcaption>The Canucks' strong play in their skate uniforms became a myth of their 2023-24 season.</figcaption>
            </figure>

       <p>In January, <i>Daily Hive Vancouver</i> <a href="https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/canucks-win-more-wearing-black-skate-jerseys">reported</a> 
            that the Vancouver Canucks win more games when they wear their alternate uniforms — their vintage black, yellow and red "skate" set, and 
            suggested that "the Canucks feel good" when they wear them.</p>
        <p>The claims about the Canucks' uniform record were true. At the time, the Canucks were 9-1-0 in their skate uniform and 8-3-2 in their 
            regular home set. By the end of the regular season, the Canucks averaged more goals per game and had a higher winning percentage in games 
            they wore their alternate uniforms.</p>
        <p>The Canucks had a winning percentage of 0.71 in games they wore their skate uniforms. This was 10 points higher than games they wore their 
            home uniforms — a 0.60 winning percentage. On the road, their winning percentage was 0.56, and they wore their white road uniforms for all 41 
            away games.</p>
        <p>What <i>Daily Hive</i> failed to account for in this article was which games the team picked to wear their throwbacks. This season, they 
            were generally worn against weaker opponents, allowing the Canucks to score more goals. The home uniforms, conversely, were often worn for 
            games against better teams.</p>

            <div class="flourish-embed flourish-cards" data-src="visualisation/18968018"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><br>

        <p>The Canucks wore the skate uniforms for 17 games in 2023-24, scoring an average of 3.65 goals per game in these contests. When they wore the 
            home uniforms, they scored slightly less, averaging 3.42 goals per game. On the road, they averaged 3.29 goals per game — less than they did 
            during home games.</p>
        <p>Vancouver has given up fewer goals, on average, in games they wear the home uniforms. In these games, the Canucks average 2.33 goals against. 
            In games they wear the skate uniform, they average 2.53 goals against. On the road, they give up an average of 3.02.</p>
        <p>The skate uniform was also worn in multiple high-scoring games. When they wore it, the Canucks scored five or more goals six times. In their home 
            uniforms, which were worn more frequently, they scored five or more goals four times.</p>
        
            <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/18960998"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><br>

        <p>The final scores of these games may also explain why they averaged more goals against when they wore the skate. In games when they wore their home 
            uniform, the Canucks never gave up more than four goals. During skate jersey games, they did so twice.</p>
        <p>The skate was worn in some high-scoring games, five of which saw at least eight goals scored by the Canucks and their opponent combined. These games 
            were a 6–2 win over the Edmonton Oilers, a 6–5 loss to the New Jersey Devils, a 7–4 win over the San Jose Sharks, a 6–4 win over the Toronto Maple 
            Leafs and a 5–4 overtime win over the Columbus Blue Jackets.</p>
        <p>If we consider eight combined goals to be the threshold for a high-scoring game, the home uniform was only worn for two — an 8–1 win over the Oilers 
            and a 6–3 win over the Ottawa Senators.</p>

            <!-- INSERT FLOURISH CHART WITH CRAZY GAMES HERE !!!!!! -->
        
        <p>The Canucks' starting goalie, Thatcher Demko, recorded four of his six shutouts this season wearing the home uniform. He had one on the road, and one 
            in the skate uniform. Conversely, two of his three worst performances of the season came in skate uniform games — he had a .750 save percentage on Feb. 29 
            against the Los Angeles Kings, and an .813 save percentage in the 6–5 loss to the Devils.</p>
        <p>Demko's worst performance in a home uniform game was his eighth-worst of the season, when he had a .846 save percentage in a loss to the Seattle 
            Kraken. His worst seven were either on the road or skate uniform games.</p>
        <p>Demko used a separate set of goalie equipment for games the Canucks donned the skate, so it's possible that either his pads, glove or blocker were stiffer 
            than his normal set used with the home and road uniforms. Regardless, his team supported him with more goals across these games.</p>    

            <!-- INSERT FLOURISH CHART WITH DEMKO STATS HERE !!!!!! -->

        <p>It's easy to refute these numbers, given the smaller sample size of skate jersey games. But the Canucks' alternate jersey schedule, which leaned 
            heavily toward opponents in the lower echelon of the NHL standings, is also to blame.</p>
        <p>The Canucks' league rank over the 2023-24 season was third out of 32 teams, regardless of which uniform they wore.</p>
        <p>The average rank of the Canucks' opponent during skate jersey games was 22 out of 32. The skate uniform was worn against many bottom-tier teams like 
            the Anaheim Ducks, Chicago Blackhawks, Columbus Blue Jackets and twice against the San Jose Sharks, who finished last in the NHL this season.</p>
        <p>At the time of each game, only one team the Canucks faced in their skate uniform was ranked in the league's top 10 — the Dallas Stars, who beat the 
            Canucks 3–1 on March 28.</p>
        <p>The home uniform was worn against several top-rate opponents, including eight games against top 10 teams.</p>

        <p>So, did the Canucks' uniform choice impact their performance?</p>
        <p>The evidence we have says no. </p>
        <p>debunk myth that uniform impacts performance. would be nice if canucks can wear the uniform more often since 
            it is so popular with fans and players, but it won't make the team play better.</p>
