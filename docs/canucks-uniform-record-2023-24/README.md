# Analyzing the trend of smaller stadiums across Major League Baseball
### What I aimed to accomplish
In March, about a week after I got into the Lede Program, I tried to write an article on this topic for <i>The Canuck Way.</i> 

It was terrible. It was my first data article. I couldn't get my visualizations to work so I just threw all of my numbers into tables. It was also done before the end of the regular season, meaning that my analysis was missing a few weeks' worth of games.

This isn't a masterpiece, but it's a much better, re-done analysis of the Vancouver Canucks' complete 2023-24 uniform record.

### Description of my findings
I remember reading a Daily Hive article published in January that said the Canucks win more when they wear their alternate uniforms. I thought about why this was the case, and how I could prove it this was factual or just a theory.

I found that the team generally wore these uniforms against weaker opponents, and wore their regular home uniform for most games against top 10 teams in the league. They scored more goals in these games than they did while wearing their other two uniforms.

There were also quite a few wild games played in the skate uniform, with many high-scoring contests â€” those I define as having eight or more goals scored between the two teams. Subpar goaltending was to blame for some of these.

### Summary of my data collection process
I got all of my data from Hockey Reference, and used Pandas to clean and analyze it. I then used Pandas to create a new dataframe with each uniform's statistics.

I repeated this process for each stat I wanted to analyze.

### Overview of my data analysis process
See above for details.

### Skills and approaches I used, where I grew most during the project
I continue to feel more comfortable and confident using Pandas, HTML and Flourish interactivity. I think I've grown a lot in working with data sets and analyzing them in Pandas over the summer. There's still way more I can learn, but I'm happy with what I've accomplished so far.

### Things I tried or wanted to do, but did not have the skills or time to
I really wanted to do something with ai2html or interactive scrollytelling, but that was way too ambitious given the timeframe I had to finish this project. I've kept my failed ai2html files in a folder here.
