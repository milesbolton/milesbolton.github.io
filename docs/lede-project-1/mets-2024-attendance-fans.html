                An analysis of the team’s history and current state seeks to explain why.</p>

        </div>
        <p>It’s just before 7 p.m. on a late-June Friday evening in Queens, New York. In just over 20 minutes, the surging Mets will take the field for 
            their series opener against the Astros. It’s a clear, comfortable evening, the temperature dropping to 71 degrees. A light breeze blows in off 
            Flushing Bay.</p>
        <p>Most of the 32,465 attendees this evening are not yet in their seats. Some disembark from the 7 train. Others take photos of the home run apple 
            or the Tom Seaver statue. In the team store, a small crowd gathers around a rack of last season’s jerseys, half price. The longest line, as 
            expected at every Mets home game, is at Shake Shack in center field.</p>
        <p>The crowd fills more than three quarters of <a href="https://www.citifieldstadium.com/seating-chart/">Citi Field’s 41,800 seats</a> as the first 
            few innings go by. Following a disastrous start to the season that included five straight losses and a significant drop in attendance from 2023, 
            the Mets have righted the ship. They would beat the Astros 7–2, improving their season record to 40–39 and average attendance to 26,877. By the 
            end of the weekend, the Mets’ 2024 average attendance would climb to 26,996 as their record fell back under .500.</p>
        <p>This number is still well below the 31,772 averaged by the Mets last season — the largest attendance drop across Major League Baseball.</p>
        <p>At this point last season, the Mets were 9th in attendance. Now, they’re 19th and without an immediate solution to their attendance woes.</p>

            (function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var 
            r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
            </script>

        <p>The attendance drop is nothing new. In April, multiple news outlets reported on the Mets’ lack of attendance at home games, prompting 
            explanations from players and fans as to why nobody was coming to Citi Field.</p>
        <p>The home opener, as usual, was a sellout. A sellout crowd of 42,137 watched the Mets’ offense sputter out of the gate to begin the season, as 
            they mustered one hit in a <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/sports/mlb/mets/2024/03/29/ny-mets-brewers-score-opening-day-2024-offense-stats/73110924007/">3–1 loss</a> 
            to the Milwaukee Brewers. Opening Day was an accurate representation of where the Mets were, and an obvious cause of poor attendance.</p>
        <p>The Mets are not a good team right now. They began their season with a five-game winless streak, and likely won’t qualify for the postseason as 
            they look to build toward contending in 2025 or 2026. This season has been left as a transition year, leaving fans little to be excited about.</p>
        <p>“It has been cold and maybe just not as excited about this year, with all the hype that was around the past two years and maybe not feeling as hopeful 
            this year without quite the big moves in the offseason,” outfielder Brandon Nimmo <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/04/17/sports/mets-playing-like-team-worth-fans-money-despite-disappointing-citi-field-attendance/">told reporters</a> 
            in April. “Success would definitely bring people back. This is kind of a show-it town, so it depends on if we remain successful and keep winning series.</p>
        <p>Unlike their crosstown counterpart Yankees, who are the most prestigious club in MLB and can sell tickets based on name value and history alone, 
            the Mets’ market demands success. Simply put, <a href="https://www.nj.com/mets/2024/04/why-arent-fans-going-to-mets-games-ny-hosts-have-theory.html">the Mets need to win games</a> 
            in order to sell tickets.</p>
        <p>Attendance at Mets’ games has oscillated over the team’s history, but playoff success has always led to a spike in ticket sales.</p>

        <p>In 1969, the Mets won their first World Series. That season, they averaged 26,529 fans per game at Shea Stadium, their former home. The following 
            year, that number rose to 32,896. Attendance dropped over the following two decades as the team fell to the bottom of the standings.</p>
        <p>The Mets became better in the late-1980s, and attendance at Shea Stadium began to rise, again peaking in the years following the team’s 1986 World 
            Series championship.</p>
        <p>This pattern repeated in the late-1990s, as the Mets lost in the National League Championship Series in 1999, then the World Series in 2000, and 
            again in the late-2000s, when they lost the 2006 NLCS.</p>
        <p>In 2008, the Mets played their final season at Shea Stadium and set a franchise attendance record despite not making the postseason. On average, 
            49,902 fans showed up to home games that year to say goodbye to Shea, where the Mets had played since 1964.</p>
        <p>The smaller Citi Field hasn’t come close to the 2008 attendance record. The Mets saw a slight uptick in attendance in 2016, following a World 
            Series appearance the previous year.</p>

         <p>With the Mets on track to miss the postseason for the second year in a row, it’s no wonder that fans — both diehard and casual — aren’t 
            showing up.</p>
         <p>Mediocre baseball isn’t enough of a selling point for the Mets. <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/sports/mlb/mets/2024/05/23/ny-mets-attendance-has-dropped-by-more-than-21-percent-to-begin-2024/73801718007/">NorthJersey.com</a> 
            reported early in the season that fans were dissuaded by traffic getting to Citi Field. For those that do drive, parking can exceed the cost of a 
            ticket to the game — <a href="https://www.mlb.com/mets/ballpark/transportation/driving-parking">$40 on weekends</a>. For comparison, 
            the cheapest resale ticket to the Mets’ next weekend game on July 12 is $22 on <a href="https://gametime.co/">Gametime</a>.</p>
         <p>Citi Field is also served by a single subway line — the 7 train — while Yankee Stadium is served by three — the B, D and 4 lines.</p>
         <p>The Yankees also hold an advantage in the New York baseball market. They’re more iconic and have been around longer than the Mets, with more 
            star players and championships over their history. A casual New York tourist would probably recognize them over the Mets.</p>
         <p>The Yankees are also a much better team than the Mets. They have baseball’s most expensive roster — an estimated payroll of $291,463,084 — 
            and superstars in Aaron Judge, Juan Soto and Gerrit Cole. The Mets’ star players, Pete Alonso and Francisco Lindor, are good but not close to the 
            same talent level.</p>
         <p>Given the choice, which team would you rather see?</p>
         <p>While the Mets have struggled to sell games for the majority of their home games this season, three dates stand out: the Subway Series against the 
            Yankees, and Opening Day. These games are the top three attended Mets games of the season, and were also the top three in 2023.</p>
         <p>The Subway Series is a famous matchup between the two New York teams, and the two local fan bases combine to fill their stadiums. The series will 
            continue later this month when the Mets visit Yankee Stadium. Opening Day is a tradition for all diehard baseball fans, marking the start of a new 
            season.</p>
        
            <iframe title="Mets struggling to sell tickets to non-marquee games" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-5goXv" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5goXv/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="1189" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
            </script>
        
        <p>Excluding Opening Day and the Subway series, only one of the Mets’ top 10 attended games in 2024 so far took place on a weekday. This game was 
            against the Los Angeles Dodgers, another team full of superstars like Mookie Betts and Shohei Ohtani.</p>
        <p>One game in the top 10, aside from Opening Day, took place in the first month of the season, when temperatures are cooler. That game, April 14 
            against the Kansas City Royals, was when Doc Gooden’s 
            number was retired.</p>
        <p>Like the Mets’ historic attendance record has shown, fans will show up for special events. They did the same thing in 2008 when the team said goodbye 
            to Shea.</p>
        <p>One can only hope that these numbers will continue to be buoyed by the team’s record closer to .500, and the summer tourist season bringing in 
            out-of-town visitors.</p>
        <p>If Mets games can be anything like their June 28 win over the Houston Astros, that’d be a win for fans and the team. Because when Citi Field is full,
             and the Mets are playing well, there’s no place you’d rather be.</p>
