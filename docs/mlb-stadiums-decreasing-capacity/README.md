# Analyzing the trend of smaller stadiums across Major League Baseball
### What I aimed to accomplish
I wanted to analyze the trend of decreasing seating capacity at professional baseball stadiums in North America.

### Description of my findings
I found that there has indeed been a decrease in seating capacity in recent history â€” the league average has dropped by around 10,000 over the past 30 years.
This is due to a number of reasons, but the most common ones include changes in ballpark construction trends and the need to cater to the current generation of fans, who value in-game entertainment and social spaces. Teams like the Toronto Blue Jays and Colorado Rockies have recently replaced some of their upper deck seats with bars and standing room areas.

### Summary of my data collection process
All of my data is publically available on Wikipedia. I scraped the current season's capacity numbers from <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_Major_League_Baseball_stadiums'>this page</a>, then verified it on each stadium's Wikipedia page. I then manually created spreadsheets with each stadium's historical capacity data from 1994, 2004 and 2014 since this information was located on several different pages.
I scraped the historical capacities of Rogers Centre and Progressive Field from their Wikipedia pages.

### Overview of my data analysis process
I analyzed the historic and current capacities to see which teams had a change, and researched what amd why they did.

### Skills and approaches I used, where I grew most during the project
This was my first project where I tried web scraping and scrollytelling. I also used Flourish instead of Datawrapper, to make more complicated visuals. Altogether more complicated than the last one, but I'm happy with the more complex skill set I used during this project.

### Things I tried or wanted to do, but did not have the skills or time to
I would've loved to look at more stadiums in depth or do an AI2HTML animated chart to show the change over time.
