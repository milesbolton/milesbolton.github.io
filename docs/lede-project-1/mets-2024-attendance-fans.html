                An analysis of the team’s history and current state seeks to explain why.</p>

        </div>
        <p>It’s just before 7 p.m. on a late-June Friday evening in Queens. In a little over 20 minutes, the surging New York Mets will take the field for 
            their series opener against the Houston Astros. The night is clear and comfortable, perfect for summer baseball. The temperature drops to 
            71 degrees. A light breeze blows in off Flushing Bay.</p>
        <p>Most of the 32,465 attendees are not yet in their seats. Some disembark from the 7 train. Others pose for photos by the home run apple 
            or the Tom Seaver statue outside the Jackie Robinson Rotunsa. In the team store, a small crowd gathers around a rack of last season’s jerseys, 
            all half price, looking for one that isn't a triple extra large. The longest line, as usual at every Mets home game, is at Shake Shack in 
            center field.</p>
        <p>The crowd fills more than three quarters of <a href="https://www.citifieldstadium.com/seating-chart/">Citi Field’s 41,800 seats</a> as the first 
            few innings go by. Following a disastrous 0–5 start to the season and a significant drop in attendance from 2023, the Mets have waited ages for a 
            night like this. They would beat Houston 7–2 in front of a large, loud Citi Field crowd that stayed long after the final pitch to watch the fireworks.
            Despite improving their record to 40–39 and bringing their average attendance to 26,877, the Mets were 10 spots lower in Major League Baseball attendance
            than they were in 2023.</p>
        <p>By the end of the weekend, the Mets’ 2024 average attendance had climbed to 26,996. This number is still well below the 31,772 they averaged a season ago — 
            the largest attendance drop of any MLB team this season.</p>
        <p>By the end of June 2023, the Mets were 9th in MLB attendance. Now, they’re 19th and without an immediate solution to their attendance woes.</p>

            <iframe title="Mets have the largest attendance drop of any MLB team since last season" aria-label="Range Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-rO3XI" 
            src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/rO3XI/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="721" 
            data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var 
            e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
            </script>

        <p>The attendance drop is nothing new. In the first few weeks of the season, multiple news outlets reported on the Mets’ lack of attendance at home games, prompting 
            explanations from players and fans as to why nobody was coming to Citi Field.</p>
        <p>The home opener, as usual, was a sellout. A crowd of 42,137 watched the Mets sputter out of the gate on to begin the season, as 
            they mustered one hit in a <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/sports/mlb/mets/2024/03/29/ny-mets-brewers-score-opening-day-2024-offense-stats/73110924007/">3–1 loss</a> 
            to the Milwaukee Brewers on March 29. In many ways, Opening Day was a representation of where the Mets were, and why they struggled at the box office.</p>
        <p>The Mets are not a good team right now. They likely won’t qualify for the postseason as they look to build toward contending in 2025 or 2026, leaving this season as a transition year. 
            There isn't much to be excited about.</p>

            <iframe title="Mets are 19th in MLB average attendance in 2024" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-iP70i" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iP70i/1/" scrolling="no"

        <p>“It has been cold and maybe just not as excited about this year, with all the hype that was around the past two years and maybe not feeling as hopeful 
            this year without quite the big moves in the offseason,” Mets outfielder Brandon Nimmo <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/04/17/sports/mets-playing-like-team-worth-fans-money-despite-disappointing-citi-field-attendance/">told reporters</a> 
            in April. “Success would definitely bring people back. This is kind of a show-it town, so it depends on if we remain successful and keep winning series.</p>
        <p>Unlike their crosstown counterpart New York Yankees, who are the most prestigious club in MLB and can sell tickets based on name value and history alone, 
            the Mets’ market demands success. Simply put, <a href="https://www.nj.com/mets/2024/04/why-arent-fans-going-to-mets-games-ny-hosts-have-theory.html">the Mets need to win games</a> 
            in order to sell tickets.</p>
        <p>Attendance at Mets’ games has oscillated over the team’s history, but playoff success has always led to a spike in ticket sales.</p>

        <p>In 1969, the Mets won their first World Series. That season, they averaged 26,529 fans per game at Shea Stadium, their former home. The following 
            year, that number rose to 32,896. Attendance dropped over the following two decades as the team fell to the bottom of the standings.</p>
        <p>The Mets became better as a second championship window opened in the late-1980s, and attendance at Shea Stadium began to rise again, peaking in the 
            years following the team’s 1986 World Series championship.</p>
        <p>This pattern repeated in the late-1990s — the Mets lost in the National League Championship Series in 1999, then the World Series in 2000 — and 
            again in the late-2000s, when they lost the 2006 NLCS.</p>
        <p>In 2008, the Mets played their final season at Shea Stadium and set a franchise attendance record despite not making the postseason. On average, 
            49,902 fans showed up to home games that year to say goodbye to Shea, where the Mets had played since 1964.</p>
        <p>The smaller Citi Field hasn’t come close to the 2008 attendance record. The Mets saw a slight uptick in attendance in 2016, following a World 
            Series appearance the previous year.</p>
        
            <iframe title="Mets' attendance heavily tied to on-field success" aria-label="Interactive area chart" id="datawrapper-chart-l1ldz"

            r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
            </script>
        
         <p>With a second consecutive season without postseason baseball in Queens, it’s no wonder that fans — both diehard and casual — aren’t 
            showing up.</p>
         <p>Mediocre baseball isn’t enough of a selling point for this market. <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/sports/mlb/mets/2024/05/23/ny-mets-attendance-has-dropped-by-more-than-21-percent-to-begin-2024/73801718007/">NorthJersey.com</a> 
            reported early in the season that fans were dissuaded by traffic getting to Citi Field. For those that do drive, parking can exceed the cost of a 
            ticket to the game — <a href="https://www.mlb.com/mets/ballpark/transportation/driving-parking">$40 on weekends</a>. For comparison, 
            the cheapest resale ticket to the Mets’ next weekend game on July 12 is $22 on <a href="https://gametime.co/">Gametime</a>.</p>
         <p>Citi Field is also served by a single subway line — the 7 train — while Yankee Stadium is served by three — the B, D and 4 lines.</p>
         <p>The Yankees also hold a major advantage in the New York baseball market. They’re more iconic and have been around longer than the Mets, with more 
            star players and championships over their history — their 27 titles are the most of any MLB club. A casual New York tourist would probably recognize them over the Mets.</p>
         <p>The Yankees are also a much better team than the Mets right now. They have baseball’s most expensive roster — their payroll is an estimated $291,463,084 according to 
            Baseball Reference — and superstars in Aaron Judge, Juan Soto and Gerrit Cole. The Mets’ star players, Pete Alonso and Francisco Lindor, are good but not close to the 
            talent level of the Yankees.</p>
         <p>Given the choice, which team would you rather see?</p>
         <p>While the Mets have struggled to sell games for the majority of their home games this season, three dates stand out: the Subway Series against the 
            Yankees, and Opening Day. These games are the top three attended Mets games of the season, and were also the top three in 2023.</p>
         <p>The Subway Series, the famous matchup between the two New York baseball clubs, causes the two local fan bases combine to fill their stadiums every year. The teams 
            play multiple games at each stadium every summer, and the series will continue later this month when the Mets visit Yankee Stadium. Opening Day is a tradition for all 
            diehard baseball fans, marking the start of a new season. For some teams, Opening Day marks the dawn of a new era. But for the Mets, it's the continuation of years of frustration.</p>
        
            <iframe title="Mets struggling to sell tickets to non-marquee games" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-5goXv" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5goXv/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="1189" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
            </script>
        
        <p>There are other factors at play, including fans' personal lives and what they're willing to show up for.</p>
        <p>Excluding Opening Day and the Subway series, only one of the Mets’ top 10 attended games this season have taken place on a weekday. This game was 
            against the Los Angeles Dodgers, another team that, like the Yankees, is full of superstars including the uber-popular Shohei Ohtani.</p>
        <p>One game in the top 10, aside from Opening Day, took place in the first month of the season, when temperatures are cooler. That game, April 14 
            against the Kansas City Royals, was when Doc Gooden’s number was retired, showing that fans will come for special events.</p>
        <p>There are no more number retirement ceremonies scheduled this season, but the Mets have seven giveaway games in July, where fans who arrive early can 
            get a free souviner like a bobblehead or a hat. The Mets also have two more fireworks nights scheduled. One can only hope that with these promotional games
            and the summer tourist season bringing in out-of-town visitors, their attendance numbers will be buoyed.</p>
        <p>And the team's season isn't finished. They're still hovering around .500, and are third in their division. They'll need to go on a run in the second half
            of the season, but the postseason is still within reach.</p>
        <p>No doubt fans, players and ownership would love that. When the Mets are winning, there's no place they'd rather be than at Citi Field, surrounded 
            by a full house.</p>
